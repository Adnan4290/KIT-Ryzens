Certainly! I'd be happy to help you with the development of a web-based endless runner game similar to Temple Run. To get started, I have a few questions:

What programming languages and frameworks are you currently using for web development? This will help me understand the technology stack we'll be working with.
Do you have any specific design preferences or themes in mind for the game? It's important to establish the visual style and overall atmosphere of the game.
Are there any particular gameplay mechanics or features you would like to include in the endless runner game? This could be power-ups, obstacles, character abilities, or any other unique aspects.
Do you have any existing assets, such as graphics or sound effects, that we can use in the game? If not, do you have a plan for acquiring or creating them?
Are there any specific platforms or devices you're targeting for the game's release? This will help us optimize the game accordingly.
1. I don't have much idea about that but I think HTML CSS AND JS on the client side while python flask should be good on the backend. You can share if you have a better plan.
2 & 3 . We have only 9 days for this and we are not experts in this field, so. I think we should make a basic game first and then add features like powerups, character powers etc. I think the map should look like the danger dash game, if you know.
4. No, we don't have any assets. We will create them and we are not experts in that so you also need to help us with that too.
5. We are targeting the web browser. So, it should be playable on any device with a web browser. Primary target is mobile devices and after that we will think of desktops.
